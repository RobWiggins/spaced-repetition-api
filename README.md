# Spaced-Repetition API

This back-end web server utilizes spaced repetition to help people memorize words in French. It hosts words in French and asks you to recall the translation of the corresponding word in English.

As a prospective user, you can register an account so that you can login and use the application to save your progress. As a registered user, you can login to the application to begin learning.

The home dashboard shows your language, words to learn, and score for each word. The learning page asks you to input the translation of a word, which will subsequently give you feedback on whether you were correct. The words that you miss more frequently are shown more frequently. Upon mastery of each word, each word will get asked progressively less often.

## Live Demo (front-end and back-end integrated link): https://spaced-repetition.michaelromero09.now.sh
## backend domain (for HTTP request purposes): https://spaced-rep-server1.herokuapp.com

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the front-end project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. This client runs locally in conjunction with the Spaced-Repetition client, which can be found at https://github.com/thinkful-ei-dragonfly/spaced-repetition-api-rob-michaelR).

## Local dev setup

If using user `dunder-mifflin`:

```bash
mv example.env .env
createdb -U dunder-mifflin spaced-repetition
createdb -U dunder-mifflin spaced-repetition-test
```

If your `dunder-mifflin` user has a password be sure to set it in `.env` for all appropriate fields. Or if using a different user, update appropriately.

```bash
npm install
npm run migrate
env MIGRATION_DB_NAME=spaced-repetition-test npm run migrate
```

And `npm test` should work at this point

## Configuring Postgres

For tests involving time to run properly, configure your Postgres database to run in the UTC timezone.

1. Locate the `postgresql.conf` file for your Postgres installation.
   1. E.g. for an OS X, Homebrew install: `/usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf`
   2. E.g. on Windows, _maybe_: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11.2\data\postgresql.conf`
   3. E.g  on Ubuntu 18.04 probably: '/etc/postgresql/10/main/postgresql.conf'
2. Find the `timezone` line and set it to `UTC`:

```conf
# - Locale and Formatting -

datestyle = 'iso, mdy'
#intervalstyle = 'postgres'
timezone = 'UTC'
#timezone_abbreviations = 'Default'     # Select the set of available time zone
```

## Scripts

Start the application `npm start`
